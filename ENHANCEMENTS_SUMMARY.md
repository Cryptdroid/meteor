## Technical Implementation Details

### Dependencies Added
```json
{
  "@react-three/postprocessing": "latest",
  "postprocessing": "latest"
}
```

### Key Technologies Used
- **Framer Motion**: All animations and transitions
- **React Three Fiber**: 3D rendering engine
- **@react-three/drei**: Helper components (OrbitControls, Stars, Float, etc.)
- **@react-three/postprocessing**: Post-processing effects
- **Zustand**: State management
- **Next.js Dynamic Imports**: Code splitting for 3D scenes

### Performance Optimizations
1. **Instanced Rendering**: Asteroid field uses instanced mesh (100 objects = 1 draw call)
2. **Dynamic Imports**: 3D scenes load only when needed
3. **Suspense Boundaries**: Graceful loading with fallbacks
4. **useMemo**: Cached computations for asteroid positions
5. **Lazy Loading**: Components load on demand

### Animation Techniques
1. **Layout Animations**: Smooth transitions with layoutId
2. **Stagger Children**: Sequential entrances for lists
3. **Spring Physics**: Natural motion with spring transitions
4. **Variants**: Reusable animation patterns
5. **whileHover/whileTap**: Interactive micro-animations
